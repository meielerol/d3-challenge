## Background Data

Data set is gathered from the US Census Bureau and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. It is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). Included is rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error" though these data points were not utilized in the visualization.
